# Quick Folder Key Navigation (QuickNav)

## Description

This is an extension (add-on) for Thunderbird that makes it possible to quickly jump
  to a desired folder in the folder tree. In Thunderbird version 102
 and earlier, one can quickly navigate the folder tree by typing 
the first part or all of a folder name when the folder tree has the 
focus.

Note that single-letter Thunderbird short-cuts (such as "n" and "p" which move to the next and previous unread messages respectively) do not work in the
folder pane when key navigation is enabled. Therefore, There is an option to turn key navigation on/off, as well as for adding this item to the context
menu when the folder pane has the focus.

The Thunderbird UI was completely redesigned in Thunderbird 115. As a 
consequence, the mail folder tree is not  capable of responding to 
key presses and QuickNav can no longer take advantage of this 
functionality. Instead, QuickNav makes it possible to quickly 
navigate to a particular folder in the folder pane  in Thunderbird 
115.0 and later by clicking on the "QuickNav" button (or pressing 
F4) and  typing the first few letters of the folder name into the 
Search box that appears. If multiple folders start with the same 
prefix, you can cycle through them using  the up and down arrow 
keys. Click the "Go" button (or press ENTER) to jump to the selected
 folder or Esc to cancel the operation. 

Using the Search method control, The way searching is carried out can be
 changed to "match anywhere" to allow searching for text that 
appears anywhere in the folder name, instead of only at the 
beginning of the folder name, which is what  the default "Match from
 start" method does.

In Thunderbird 121.0 and later, an additional "Go to new tab" button (or
  pressing CTRL+ENTER) allows the selected folder to be opened in a 
new mail tab.

**Note for JAWS users:**
 if you have Forms Mode set to Manual, it is necessary to press 
ENTER when the QuickNav dialog opens in order to type into the 
search box. As this is extremely  inconvenient, it is recommended 
that you uncheck  the 'Disable forms Mode when a  new page is 
loaded' option in JAWS Settings Center. This will cause you to be 
placed  into the edit field immediately when the QuickNav dialog 
opens. Alternatively, this can also be achieved by setting Forms 
Mode to anything other than Manual. The verbosity of  screen-reader 
speech can be adjusted using the 'Screen-reader verbosity' combo box
 in the QuickNav dialog.
